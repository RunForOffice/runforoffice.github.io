        <h3>Decision Points</h3>
          <p>The ethnicity factor was recoded to “White”, “Black or African-American”, and “Other”.his decision was made taking into consideration two factors. 1) Races other than Black or White make up 5.2% of the Louisiana population, and consistently less than 5% of the data. Taking all of those groups together makes it easier to discern their collective status, relative to miniscule individual populations and 2) There was some uncertainty surrounding the ethnicity classifications other than “W” and “B”, and there was not adequate time to investigate the issue.</p>
      <h1>Analysis & Visualization</h1>
        <p>To view the analysis, click <a href="doc.html">here</a>. All cleaning and analysis work was done in R, with visualization and documentation in ggplot and RMarkdown.<p>
      <h1>Advice & Guidance</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>For best results, start with simple questions. As a person, what's interesting to you about trends in government? How are the genders represented? How are ethnicity and race represented? Are these trends consistent across levels of government?</li>
          <li>If you hit a roadblock, ask the Slack channel!</li>
